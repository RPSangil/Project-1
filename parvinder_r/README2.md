# Project-1; Group-3 - Technical Analysis - Crypto Vs Stock


## "The Individual Investor should act consistently as an Investor and not as a Speculator or a Gambler"


## Background

If youâ€™re a first-time investor, and have not much knowledge of how and where to invest, it could be a daunting task.  Raelyn, is a first time investor and reached out to us for help.
Throughout 2020 and 2021, she watched closely that people who invested in stocks and cyrptos made insane gains and wondered how she can replicate that strategy for herself.

Raelyn, has kept aside $20,0000 to be invested over a period of time.  She asked us to research and analyse the following:
* How top stocks and top crypto assests have performed over last 5 years.
* How volatile these assets could be to any foreseen blackswan event or Market uncertainties
* How much returns these assets would give, if invested $20,000?
1. Scenario 1:  Equally among top 5 market cap stocks and cryptos?
2. Scenario 2:  100% in Crypto?
3. Scenario 3:  100% in Stocks?
4. Scenario 4:  60% in Stocks and 40% in Cryptos?
5. Scenario 5:  60% in Crypto and 40% in Stocks?
