# "The individual investor should act coinsistenctly as an investor and not as a speculator"


## Background

If youâ€™re a first-time investor, and have not much knowledge of how and where to invest, it could be a daunting task.  Raelyn, is a first time investor and reached out to us for help.
Throughout 2020 and 2021, she watched closely that people who invested in stocks and cyrpto made insane gains and wondered how she can replicate that strategy for herself.

Raelyn, has kept aside $20,0000 to be invested over a period of time.  She asked us to researchand perform an analysis of the following:
* How top stocks and top crypto assests have performed over last 5 years.
* How volatile these assets could be to any foreseen blackswan event or Market uncertainties
* How much returns these assets would have given had she invested $20,000?
        1. *Scenario 1*:  equally amoung the top 5 stocks and cryptos?
        2. *Scenario 2*:  100% in Crypto?
        3. *Scenario 3*:  100% in Stocks?
        4. *Scenario 4*:  60% in Stocks and 40% in Cryptos?
        5. *Scenario 5*:  60% in Crypto and 40% in Stocks?

### Raelyn wants to be an Investor and hence doing her due deligence, rather than being a 'Speculator' or 'Gambler' in the space

#### What do you want to be?
