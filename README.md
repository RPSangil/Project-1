Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that has been designed to work a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant through on any central authority (government or bank) to uphold and maintain it.[<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)

<ins> Bitcoin *BTC* </ins> - Created and released by Satoshi Nakomoto, this cryptocurrency has a limited supply of 21 million and works on a blockchain ledger. It is easily moved from one exchange account or digital wallet to another and easily transferred from one user to another or merchant. Many experts believe that these factors give the Bitcoin the value that it currently has today.[<sup>2</sup>](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/why-do-bitcoins-have-value/#:~:text=Limited%20supply%3A%20Bitcoin's%20maximum%20supply,one%20can%20counterfeit%20a%20Bitcoin.)

<ins> Ethereum *ETH* </ins> - Via blockchain technology, Ethereum is the largest and most well-established, open-ended decentralized software platform. It enables the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. Ether (ETH) is the fuel used to run commands in the Ethereum platform and is used by developers to build and run applications on the platform.[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031416/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-driven-different-purposes.asp#:~:text=Ethereum%20Basics,-Blockchain%20technology%20is&text=Ethereum%20enables%20the%20deployment%20of,interference%20from%20a%20third%20party.)

<ins> Litecoin *LTC* </ins> - Litecoin was developed to be a compliment to Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakomoto saw that a major drawback of Bitcoin would be the speed in which it adds blocks. Litecoin has improved speed (2.5 minutes per block on average) and accessibility when compared to Bitcoin. However, this currency has a higher limited supply of 84 million. Litecoin was made to be a more practical and scalable medium than Bitcoin. It is now one of the most recognized, trusted and used blockchain-based payment networks in the world.[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/litecoin-vs-bitcoin-blockchain#section-litecoin-is-a-complement-to-bitcoin-not-a-competitor)

<ins> Ripple *XRP* </ins> - Ripple is a technology that acts as both a cryptocurrency and a digital payment network for financial transactions. It was first released in 2012 and was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. Ripple's main process is a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, similar to the SWIFT system for international money and security transfers, which is used by banks and financial middlemen dealing across currencies.[<sup>5</sup> (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ripple-cryptocurrency.asp)

<ins> Cardano *ADA* </ins> - Other than being a cryptocurrency, every ADA holder also holds a stake in the Cardano network. ADA stored in a wallet can be delegated to a stake pool to earn rewards (to participate in the successful running of the network ) or pledged to a stake pool to increase the pool's likelihood of receiving rewards. In time, ADA will also be usable for a variety of applications and services on the Cardano platform.
